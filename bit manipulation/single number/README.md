### Given an array of integers A, every element appears twice except for one. Find that integer that occurs once.

### NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

<hr>
2 <= |A| <= 2000000<br>
0 <= A[i] <= INTMAX

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]<br>
Output: 3
