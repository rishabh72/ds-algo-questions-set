### Given an integer array A of size N, find the first repeating element in it.

### We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of the first occurrence is the smallest.

### If there is no repeating element, return -1.

<hr>
1 <= N <= 105<br>
1 <= A[i] <= 109

Input:  A = [10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]<br>
Output: 5<br>
Input: A = [6, 10, 5, 4, 9, 120]<br>
Output: -1<br>
