### Shaggy has an array A consisting of N elements. We call a pair of distinct indices in that array a special if elements at those indices in the array are equal.

### Shaggy wants you to find a special pair such that the distance between that pair is minimum. Distance between two indices is defined as |i-j|. If there is no special pair in the array, then return -1.
