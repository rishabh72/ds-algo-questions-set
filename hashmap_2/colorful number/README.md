#### Given a number A, find if it is COLORFUL number or not.

#### If number A is a COLORFUL number return 1 else, return 0.

#### What is a COLORFUL Number:

#### A number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts.

#### Suppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245.

#### And this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different.
