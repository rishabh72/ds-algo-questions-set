### Surprisingly, in an alien language, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

### Given an array of words A of size N written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet denoted by string B of size 26, return 1 if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language else, return 0.

<hr>
1 <= N, length of each word <= 105<br>

Sum of the length of all words <= 2 \* 106
