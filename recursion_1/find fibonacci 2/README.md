### The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.

### 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

### In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation:

## Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

### Given a number A, find and return the Ath Fibonacci Number.

### Given that F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
