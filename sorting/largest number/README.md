### Given an array A of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
<br>

### Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
<hr>
 1 <= len(A) <= 100000<br>
 0 <= A[i] <= 2*109<br>
 <hr>
Input:  A = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]<br>
Output: "9534330"<br>
