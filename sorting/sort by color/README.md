Given an array with N objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
<br>
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent red, white, and blue, respectively.
<br>
Note: Using the library sort function is not allowed.
<hr>
1 <= N <= 1000000<br>
0 <= A[i] <= 2<br>
<hr>
Input: A = [0 1 2 0 1 2]<br>
Output: [0 0 1 1 2 2]<br>
