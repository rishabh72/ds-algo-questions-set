### Given the array of strings A, you need to find the longest string S, which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.

### The longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.

### Example: the longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".

<hr>
0 <= sum of length of all strings <= 1000000

Input:<br>
A = ["abcdefgh", "aefghijk", "abcefgh"]<br>
Output: "a"
